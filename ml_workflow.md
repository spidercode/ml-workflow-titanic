# ML Workflow – Titanic Survival Prediction

## 1. Problem Type
Binary classification problem where the goal is to predict one of two outcomes.

## 2. Business Objective
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on available passenger information.

## 3. Target Variable
Survived (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).

## 4. Why Machine Learning?
Survival depends on multiple interacting factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare, making rule-based approaches insufficient.

## 5. Success Metric
Accuracy and recall, with particular emphasis on recall to minimize false negatives.

## 6. Baseline Expectation
A useful model should perform better than random guessing and show consistent performance on unseen data.
